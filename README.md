->  CODEALPHA TASK-3 : Hotel reservation system 

programming language : JAVA

TASK :
Develop a program that allows a teacher to enter
students' grades and compute their average,
highest, and lowest scores. You can use arrays or
ArrayLists to store the student data

# Explanation of the program :

A hotel reservation system in Java manages booking processes, room availability, and guest information. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of its components and functionalities:



Room Class: Represents a hotel room with attributes like room number, type (e.g., single, double), price per night, and availability status. Methods include checking availability and booking the room.



Hotel Class: Manages a collection of rooms using ArrayList or another suitable data structure. It initializes rooms upon creation and provides methods to search for available rooms by type and book rooms based on user requests.



Reservation Class: Represents a booking made by a guest. It includes attributes such as reservation ID, guest name, booked room object, and payment status. Methods handle marking reservations as paid and displaying reservation details.



Main Class (HotelReservationSystem): Acts as the entry point for the program. It provides a user interface via the command line or GUI, allowing users to:
 1.Search Available Rooms: Users can specify room type (single, double, suite) and view available options.
 
 2.Book a Room: Users select a room by entering its number, and the system confirms the booking if the room is available.
 
 3.Pay for Reservation: Placeholder functionality in this example, typically involving payment processing and confirmation.
 
 4.View Booking Details: Placeholder functionality to display reservation details like guest name, room number, total cost, and payment status.
 
 5.Exit : Allows users to exit the program.



This system utilizes object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation (private attributes and public methods), inheritance (if extending room types or guest details), and polymorphism (through method overrides or interfaces). It offers a structured approach to managing hotel bookings, enhancing user experience through efficient room search, booking, and reservation management functionalities. Extensions could include user authentication, database integration for persistent data storage, or a graphical user interface for enhanced usability.
