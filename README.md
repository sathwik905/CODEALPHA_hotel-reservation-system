->  CODEALPHA TASK-3 : Hotel reservation system 

programming language : JAVA

TASK :
Develop a program that allows a teacher to enter
students' grades and compute their average,
highest, and lowest scores. You can use arrays or
ArrayLists to store the student data

# Explanation of the program :

The Java program simulates a hotel reservation system with several classes: **Room** (defines room properties and booking functionality), **Hotel** (manages a collection of rooms, allows searching for available rooms by type, and booking them), and **Reservation** (represents a booking with methods to mark payment and display details). 

**HotelReservationSystem** serves as the main class, offering a command-line interface for users. It includes options to search for available rooms by type, book a specific room, simulate payment for reservations (placeholder functionality), view basic booking details (placeholder functionality), and exit the program. 

The system initializes with dummy room data and allows dynamic interaction through user inputs via a Scanner object. This structure enables basic functionality typical of a hotel booking system, demonstrating room availability checks, booking operations, and potential extensions for payment processing and detailed booking management.
